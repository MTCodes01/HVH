## Background

In industrial settings, inefficiencies often arise from both human and machine factors:
- **Uneven Task Allocation**: Workers may be underutilized or overburdened due to inefficient task distribution.
- **Machine Downtime**: Machines that require maintenance or experience unexpected breakdowns cause delays.
- **Lack of Predictive Insights**: Without predictive maintenance and real-time data, organizations incur higher costs and productivity loss.

This platform addresses these issues by integrating real-time workforce and machine performance tracking with predictive analytics, helping optimize task assignments, machine maintenance schedules, and overall workflow.

## Features

1. **Real-Time Workforce and Machine Monitoring**:
   - Dashboard for viewing real-time status updates on worker productivity and machine performance.
   - Metrics visualization showing machine cycle time, production rate, and energy consumption.

2. **AI-Powered Task and Machine Allocation**:
   - Dynamic task assignment based on worker skill, availability, and machine status.
   - Optimal task-machine matching to reduce idle time and maximize efficiency.

3. **Predictive Maintenance for Machines**:
   - Predicts when machines will require maintenance based on historical usage data.
   - Alerts for upcoming maintenance to avoid sudden breakdowns.

4. **Detailed Reporting and Analytics**:
   - Reports summarizing productivity metrics, machine utilization, and downtime analysis.
   - Visualization of KPIs, including Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) and worker productivity.

5. **Seamless API Integration**:
   - REST API endpoints for seamless communication between the frontend and backend.
   - Data import/export support to integrate with existing industrial databases.
